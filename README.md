# Zachary Samson's Portfolio

## Description 

Welcome to repository of of Zach Samson's portfolio (version 1.0)!

I built this website to host the projects I will be completing over next 6 months while enrolled in the University of Arizona's full stack web development bootcamp.
My goal is to demonstrate both the quality of my work, and my personal growth as a web developer.

This first iteration displays my current knowledge over basic **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, & **version controle (with Git)**.
The actual portfolio site leans heavily **CSS**, and specifically **Flexbox** to host an adaptive layout for my current body of work. 

**_CSS positioning_** was the primary bottleneck I encountered with starting this build, and it was also what I found most rewarding on the other side.
It took a few refactors-- and many Google searches-- to appreciate first buidling out a wireframe, and planning my approach before writing any code. 

I am most proud of the understanding I have built around **Flexbox**, and specifcally the usage of nested **%** declarations for adaptive sizing of HTML elements. 
I hope you enjoy this first attempt, and stick around to see what I can do next!
